1. Data Collection: Get Better Images and Videos
To improve detection, you need a dataset with diverse and high-quality images where the ball and racket are clearly visible. Here’s how you can collect better data:

Use High-Resolution Videos: Record or source high-quality squash videos from multiple angles and in different lighting conditions. Ensure the resolution is sufficient to capture the small squash ball and racket details.

Pro Player Matches: Gather video data from professional squash matches or practice sessions. These are often available on platforms like YouTube or professional squash websites. Make sure to get different camera angles and scenarios (e.g., rallies, serves, volleys).

Slow Motion Videos: Use slow-motion videos to capture more details of the ball and racket's movement. This helps with accurate labeling and model training.

Varied Scenes and Players: Use data from different environments (courts, lighting conditions) and various players. The diversity in the dataset will help generalize the model to real-world scenarios.

2. Improved Labeling/Annotation
Since you mentioned that the model detects very large boxes around the racket and ball, you may need to improve the accuracy of your bounding box annotations. Here are some steps:

Smaller, More Precise Bounding Boxes: Make sure your annotations are tightly fitted to the racket and ball. Large bounding boxes that cover too much area will confuse the model. Tools like LabelImg or Roboflow's annotation platform can help you manually adjust the bounding boxes.

Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB): Since you’re using the obb task in YOLOv8, you might want to focus on oriented bounding boxes for the racket to detect it accurately in any orientation. The squash racket has different shapes when viewed from different angles, and oriented bounding boxes can capture this better.

Use Keypoint Detection: In addition to bounding boxes, consider using keypoint detection (e.g., YOLOv8 Pose or OpenPose) for precise tracking of racket positions, like identifying the racket’s handle, head, or the center of the ball. This will provide more accurate localization for these objects.

3. Data Augmentation
Augmenting your dataset can help simulate various real-world scenarios, improve generalization, and increase the accuracy of your model:

Random Cropping and Resizing: Apply random crops and resizes to simulate different distances of the camera from the players.

Blur and Noise: Add slight blurring or noise to images to simulate imperfect lighting or motion blur. This helps the model become more robust to real-world conditions.

Brightness and Contrast Adjustments: Apply changes in brightness and contrast to simulate different lighting conditions that occur in squash courts.

Perspective and Rotation: Since the squash racket and ball can appear at various angles, perspective transforms and rotations can help the model learn to identify objects from different orientations.

Synthetic Data: Consider using synthetic data (computer-generated images) to add variety to your training data. Platforms like SyntheticsAI can help create high-quality training data for specialized tasks like racket and ball detection.

4. Transfer Learning from a Pretrained Model
Fine-tuning a model that’s already trained on sports data can give you a head start:

Start from a Pretrained Model: Use a YOLOv8 model pretrained on a general object detection dataset like COCO, which contains objects like balls and bats. You can then fine-tune it on your squash-specific dataset.

More Classes (if applicable): If your dataset has more objects in the frame (e.g., players, court boundaries), you can add these to your annotation classes to provide more context to the model.

5. Training Adjustments
Here are a few ways you can tweak the training process to improve accuracy:

Adjust Image Size (imgsz): Training with a larger image size (e.g., 1024 or higher) may improve small object detection, like for the squash ball.

Modify Anchor Sizes: If your racket and ball are consistently smaller than most objects in the default dataset, adjust the anchor box sizes during training to better fit the dimensions of your targets. YOLO uses anchor boxes as starting points for object detection, and setting them correctly is important.

Label Smoothing and Augmentations in Training: Add techniques like label smoothing and random affine transformations within the YOLO training code itself to make the model more robust.

Increase Epochs and Learning Rate Tuning: If you notice underfitting, increase the number of epochs or experiment with different learning rates. Start with a slightly higher learning rate and then reduce it once performance starts to plateau.

6. Post-Processing (NMS) Adjustments
You may also want to adjust Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) thresholds to avoid large bounding boxes or overlapping detections.

Reduce IOU Threshold for NMS: Reducing the Intersection Over Union (IOU) threshold during NMS may help prevent large bounding boxes from being predicted. You can try something like:

python
Copy code
model.train(data="datasets/data.yaml", epochs=300, imgsz=1024, batch=16, project="train", iou=0.4)
7. Dataset Annotation Tools
Using better annotation tools can save time and improve accuracy:

Roboflow allows you to label data, create synthetic images, and export datasets in YOLO format.
Labelbox and SuperAnnotate are other great options for improving the labeling process.
By improving your dataset quality, using proper annotations, applying data augmentation, and adjusting model training settings, you should see significant improvements in the detection accuracy of the squash ball and racket. Let me know how it goes or if you need further help!
